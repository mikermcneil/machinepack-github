  extendedDescription:
  'The URL returned by this machine is useful for accessing private repos in situations where `ssh` is not an option (e.g. with npm).  '+
  'You can use the URL returned by this machine as a dependency in your package.json file, allowing `npm install` to grab the code for '+
  'your dependency directly from its private GitHub repo.  '+
  'NPM installing from private repo URLs is a great way to take advantage of the power of NPM when circumstances prevent you from making your '+
  'dependencies open-source.  However, be aware that you may experience occasional caching issues with PaaS deployments (Modulus, Heroku, EBS, etc) '+
  'and/or continuous integration services (like CircleCI or Travis).  This is because the current version of NPM relies completely on the SEMVER range in the '+
  'package.json file (which, in this approach, we replace with the URL generated by this machine.)  If you run into issues with code from your private GitHub '+
  'dependencies not being updated, try clearing the NPM cache (the way to do this varies across different PaaS and CI providers-- to do it locally, run `npm cache clear`.)'+
  'Caching systems are difficult design problems, and NPM does a great job 99% of the time.  Stay tuned to the NPM repo for updates, and please participate in the discussion '+
  'if you have ideas.',
