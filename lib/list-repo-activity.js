Therefore Sails doesn't work behind properly-configured proxies: it only works behind misconfigured ones.\r\n\r\nThe solution is to use the actual HTTP Host header, which -- unfortunately -- Express truncates. A simple copy/paste from Express' `request.js` will give the host and port, straight from a valid HTTP request:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n  var trustProxy = req.app.get('trust proxy');\r\n  var host = trustProxy && req.get('X-Forwarded-Host');\r\n  host = host || req.get('Host');\r\n\r\n  req.baseUrl = req.protocol + \"://\" + host;\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this change, the developer need only enable `trust proxy` to work behind any HTTP-compliant reverse proxy."
